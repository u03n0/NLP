A look at implementing common ML algorithms as they pertain to NLP tasks with real data examples.
Some will be implemented via modern libraries and frameworks and a few will be built from scratch.
- `_simple.py` with as few imports, abstractions, and mutations as possible. No classes. Reinventing the wheel... to a degree.
- `_oop.py` OOP approach, more common libraries used.
- `_sklearn/pytorch.py` using Frameworks and modern libraries.
# Goal
Go from a low-level to high-level implementation, explanation, and comparison of common ML models that are used for various NLP tasks.

## Notebooks
Jupyter notebooks are provided to break down code into smaller parts with explanations.
